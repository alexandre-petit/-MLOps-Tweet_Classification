In this project we are going to compare text features extraction models and compare the results using MLFlow.

Once the best model is selected, it will be deployed on the cloud. A local app will be use to call the model API

## 1. Finding the best models and saving experiments


## 2. Deploying the model on the cloud


## 3. Local App


## 4. Model monitoring system
